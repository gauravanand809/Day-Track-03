## Tech Stack

*   **Electron:** For building the cross-platform desktop application.
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript.
*   **Node.js:** For the Electron main process and backend API interactions.
*   **AI Integration:**
    *   Google Gemini API (via `@google/generative-ai` npm package).
    *   OpenAI-compatible APIs (via Node.js `https` module for direct HTTP requests).
*   **Charting:** Chart.js (for the dashboard).
*   **Markdown Parsing:** Marked.js.

## Prerequisites (for Development)

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm). It's recommended to use a recent LTS version.
*   An API Key for your chosen AI provider:
    *   For Google Gemini: Obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    *   For OpenAI-compatible APIs: This depends on the service (e.g., OpenRouter key, or none if using a local server without auth).

## Setup and Installation (for Development)

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the source code):**
    ```bash
    # If using Git
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd day-planner 
    # Or simply navigate to the project directory if you downloaded the source
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Open a terminal in the project root directory (`day-planner`) and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure API Key:**
    *   **Option 1 (Gemini - Recommended for Development):** Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory (`day-planner/`). Add your Gemini API key to this file if you plan to use Gemini primarily during development without initial in-app setup:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
        This `.env` key acts as a fallback if no Gemini key is set in the app's settings.
    *   **Option 2 (In-App Settings - Required for OpenAI & Preferred for Gemini):** Run the app once and configure your chosen AI provider (Gemini or OpenAI-compatible) via the "Settings" view. This is the primary way to set API credentials and endpoints.
        *   For Gemini: Enter API Key and select/specify model.
        *   For OpenAI-compatible: Enter Base URL, API Key (if any), and Model name.

## Running the Application (for Development)

To run the application in development mode:
```bash
npm start
```
This will launch the Electron application window.

## Building the Application (for Distribution)

To build distributable packages (currently configured for Linux `.deb`):
```bash
npm run dist
```
The packaged application will be found in the `dist/` directory. For example, `dist/day-planner_1.0.0_amd64.deb`.

You can install the `.deb` package on Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu) using:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i dist/day-planner_1.0.0_amd64.deb
# If there are dependency issues, run:
sudo apt-get install -f
```
